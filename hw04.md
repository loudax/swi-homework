# 第四次作业

## 使用维基百科，解释以下概念。

**ASCII**

ASCII abbreviated from American Standard Code for Information Interchange, is a character encoding standard for electronic communication. ASCII codes represent text in computers, telecommunications equipment, and other devices. Most modern character-encoding schemes are based on ASCII, although they support many additional characters.

**Color**

Color (American English) or colour (Commonwealth English) is the characteristic of human visual perception described through color categories, with names such as red, orange, yellow, green, blue, or purple. This perception of color derives from the stimulation of cone cells in the human eye by electromagnetic radiation in the visible spectrum. Color categories and physical specifications of color are associated with objects through the wavelength of the light that is reflected from them. This reflection is governed by the object's physical properties such as light absorption, emission spectra, etc.

By defining a color space, colors can be identified numerically by coordinates, which in 1931 were also named in global agreement with internationally agreed color names like mentioned above (red, orange, etc.) by the International Commission on Illumination. The RGB color space for instance is a color space corresponding to human trichromacy and to the three cone cell types that respond to three bands of light: long wavelengths, peaking near 564–580 nm (red); medium-wavelength, peaking near 534–545 nm (green); and short-wavelength light, near 420–440 nm (blue).[1][2] There may also be more than three color dimensions in other color spaces, such as in the CMYK color model, wherein one of the dimensions relates to a color's colorfulness).

## 简单回答以下问题

1. 写出字符“A”,“中”的 ASCII 码、Unicode 码、
utf-8 编码。

| 编码 | A | 中 |
|:-----|:-----|:-----|
|ASCII码| 41 | - |
|Unicode码| 0041 | 4E2D |
|utf-8 编码| 41 | E4 B8 AD |

2. 黄色(yellow)的RGB编码是(255,255,0)

3. 从网上下载一个 BMP 格式图像,用图片编辑工具另存在 jpg、 png、tiff 格式。问三种格式中,哪种格式显示质量好?相对于BMP 格式,压缩率各是多少?

tiff格式的显示质量最好，无压缩。

jpg：压缩比率通常在10：1到40：1之间，压缩率大约2.5%-10%

png：压缩比率通常在5：1到24：1之间，压缩率大约4.17%-20%

tiff：无压缩，压缩率为100%。

4. Winrar压缩文件是lossless, or lossy 方法？

lossless-无损

lossy-有损

Winrar压缩文件是lossless方法，无损压缩。
